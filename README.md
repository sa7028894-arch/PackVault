# PackVault

Offline-first package caching and distribution CLI for JavaScript and TypeScript developers.

Built by Shoaib — Developer tools for the next generation.  
🌐 Website: https://pack-vault-website.vercel.app/

PackVault is an offline-first package caching and distribution library for JavaScript developers. Download package tarballs while online, install them later without internet access, share them across your LAN, and bootstrap entire projects from a local package vault.

## Features

* ⭐ **Offline-first**: Cache packages online, use them completely offline.
* 🌐 **LAN package sharing**: Share packages over the local network via mDNS.
* 📦 **Project templates**: Bootstrap projects with dependencies completely offline.
* 🔒 **Integrity verification**: Ensures SHA-512 and shasum consistency.
* ⚡ **Peer-to-peer package sync**: P2P synchronization with authorization tokens.

## Installation

### JSR installation
You can install PackVault programmatically using JSR:
npx jsr add @shoaib/packvault

For Deno:
deno add jsr:@shoaib/packvault

### npm installation
npm install -g packvault

## Quick Start

### Cache Packages While Online
packvault sync react vite tailwindcss

Or sync directly from a lockfile:
packvault sync --from-lockfile

### Go Offline
Disconnect from the internet.

### Install From Cache
packvault install react

## CLI Usage

### Sync
packvault sync react vite tailwindcss
packvault sync --from-lockfile
packvault sync --concurrency 10

### Install
packvault install react
packvault install vite

### Bundle
packvault bundle save my-stack react vite tailwindcss
packvault bundle list

### Search
packvault search react

## API Examples

### Caching Packages Programmatically
import { CacheManager } from "@shoaib/packvault";

async function cachePackages() {
  const cache = new CacheManager();
  await cache.syncPackages(["vite", "typescript"]);
  
  const pkgPath = await cache.getPackagePath("vite", "latest");
  console.log("Vite is cached at:", pkgPath);
}

cachePackages();

### Offline Installation
import { PackageManager } from "@shoaib/packvault";

async function runOffline() {
  const manager = new PackageManager();
  const pkg = await manager.installOffline("react", "^18.0.0");
  console.log("Offline installation successful!", pkg);
}

runOffline();

## Configuration

The default configuration is stored in ~/.packvault/config.json. You can modify it or use environment variables to adjust cache paths, registry URLs, and peer-to-peer settings.

Example:
{
  "cacheDirectory": "~/.packvault/cache",
  "registry": "https://registry.npmjs.org/",
  "p2pPort": 8000
}

The core components include:
* **CacheManager**: Handles metadata and tarball caching.
* **PackageManager**: Orchestrates installations.
* **PeerManager**: Discovers and syncs with peers via mDNS.
* **LocalRegistryServer**: Exposes the local cache as a standard npm registry.

## Examples

We provide several executable examples in the examples/ directory:

* [basic.ts](./examples/basic.ts) - Basic package resolution.
* [cache.ts](./examples/cache.ts) - Sync and caching workflow.
* [offline.ts](./examples/offline.ts) - Demonstrates offline installation fallback.
* [sync.ts](./examples/sync.ts) - Peer-to-peer LAN syncing.
* [template.ts](./examples/template.ts) - Offline template scaffolding.

## FAQ

* **Q: Does PackVault replace npm or Yarn?**  
  A: No, it works alongside them. It acts as a smart cache and offline registry proxy.
* **Q: Can I use it in CI environments?**  
  A: Yes! You can point PackVault to a shared cache directory to drastically speed up CI times.
* **Q: Is it compatible with Deno and Bun?**  
  A: Yes, PackVault's core APIs and CLI are designed to be runtime agnostic where possible.
